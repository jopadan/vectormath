> FQA: To summarize: the compiler has the right to inline or not inline any function, whether it's declared inline in any of the several ways or not.<br/>
> => I decise to remove hard-to-read HLSLMATH_INLINE and HLSLMATH_CONSTEXPR macros. Use simple 'inline' keyword, just to hint the compilers. Sony's Math library do the same.

> On the other hand, I would argue that using TDD on a math library is a bad idea. Itâ€™s essential to write good unit tests for a math library, but probably not to design it through TDD. Are you really going to implement a cross product differently just because you wrote tests before? The emphasis there has to be on correctness and performance, not on creating the interface or implementation through tests.<br/>
> => Write unit tests, benchmarks after design the API

> Features<br/>
>   The Vector Math library mainly provides functions used in 3-D graphics for 3-D and 4-D vector operations, matrix operations, and quaternion operations. APIs for both the C and C++ programming languages are provided, along with three formats according to the data layout:<br/>
>       - The AoS (Array of Structures) SIMD format, which can easily and quickly be adapted to handle different situations<br/>
>       - The SoA (Structure of Arrays) SIMD format, which allows for maximum throughput<br/>
>       - The scalar format, which is useful for porting and testing<br/>
>   All three formats provide implementations for the PPU and SPU.
> => Sony's VectorMath was design for their PPU and SPU, we need an update version that work well on modern cpu.
